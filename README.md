# SPACE-MISSION Report
## The first space mission was carried out in October the 7th,1957 when the soviets launched the first artificial satellite which was a success and since then numerous space missions has taken place.
# The Task
## I got a dataset containing all space missions carried out from 1957–2022 from maven analytics . In the dataset are the 
*  Companies
* ###  The name of the rockets
* ###  The Location 
* ###  Mission status 
* ###  Date carried out
* ### Used python to clean and explore the data and power BI for visualization .
# Key Insights:
